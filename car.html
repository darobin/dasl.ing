      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The CAR format (Content Addressable aRchives) is used to store series of
        content-addressable objects as a sequence of bytes. It packages that stream of
        objects with a header.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the content of this specification was initially developed as part
        of the <a href="https://github.com/ipld/ipld">IPLD</a> project. This specification
        was developed based on demand from the community to have just the one simplified
        document. Note that a CARv2 specification was developed at some point to add
        support for an index trailer, but it met with limited adoption and so was not
        considered when bringing CAR into DASL.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Parsing CAR</h2>
      <p>
        The CAR format comprises a sequence of length-prefixed block data, where the first
        block in the CAR is the Header encoded as [<a href="#ref-drisl" class="ref">drisl</a>], and the remaining blocks form
        the Data component of the CAR and are each additionally prefixed with their CIDs ([<a href="#ref-drisl" class="ref">drisl</a>], [<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>]).
        The length prefix of each block in a CAR is encoded as an unsigned variable-length
        integer ([<a href="#ref-varint" class="ref">varint</a>], a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128">LEB128</a>).
        This integer specifies the number of remaining bytes for that block entry, excluding
        the bytes used to encode the integer, but including the CID for non-header blocks.
      </p>
      <pre><code>|------- Header -------| |------------------- Data -------------------|
[ int | DAG-CBOR block ] [ int | CID | block ] [ int | CID | block ] …
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The steps to <dfn id="dfn-parse-a-car">parse a CAR</dfn> are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Accept a byte stream <var>bytes</var> that is consumed with every step
          that reads from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the steps to <a href="#dfn-parse-a-car-header" class="dfn-ref">parse a CAR header</a> with <var>bytes</var> to obtain
          <var>metadata</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up array <var>blocks</var> and run these substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>If <var>bytes</var> is empty, terminate these substeps.</li>
            <li>
              Run the steps to <a href="#dfn-parse-a-car-block-header" class="dfn-ref">parse a CAR block header</a> with <var>bytes</var>
              to obtain <var>cid</var> and <var>block size</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read <var>block size</var> bytes from <var>bytes</var> and store the
              result in <var>block</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Push an entry onto <var>blocks</var> containing <var>cid</var>,
              <var>block size</var>, and <var>block</var>.
            </li>
            <li>Return to the beginning of these substeps.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Return <var>metadata</var> and <var>blocks</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note that the CAR header contains a near-arbitrary DRISL object that is to be
        treated as metadata ([<a href="#ref-drisl" class="ref">drisl</a>]). For historical reasons, there are two
        constraints on the header:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The object MUST contain a <code>version</code> map entry, the value of which
          is always integer-type <code>1</code>. Version numbers is data formats are
          an anti-pattern, and as a result this number is guaranteed never to change.
        </li>
        <li>
          The object MUST contain a <code>roots</code> entry, which MUST be of type
          array. It MAY be empty, but if it isn't then it must be an array of CIDs
          encoded using tag 42 ([<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>]). A CAR can be used
          to contain one or more DAGs of [<a href="#ref-drisl" class="ref">drisl</a>] content and the purpose of the
          <code>roots</code> is to list one or more roots for those DAGs. The array
          may be empty if you do not care about encoding DAGs. <strong>NOTE</strong>:
          Some implementations expect there to always be at least one root. If you do
         not wish to indicate a root but have to interoperate with those implementations,
         you can always use the empty DASL CID <code>\x01\x55\x12\x00</code> instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some implementations will only return <var>version</var> and <var>roots</var>,
        but it is RECOMMENDED that they make the entire <var>metadata</var> object
        available. A best practice for authors is to use the <var>metadata</var>
        to capture MASL content, which is able to provide metadata and a pathing
        mapping for the entire content of the CAR stream if needed ([<a href="#ref-masl" class="ref">masl</a>]).
      </p>
      <p>
        The steps to <dfn id="dfn-parse-a-car-header">parse a CAR header</dfn> are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accept a byte stream <var>bytes</var>.</li>
        <li>Read an unsigned varint <var>length</var> from <var>bytes</var> ([<a href="#ref-varint" class="ref">varint</a>]).</li>
        <li>If <var>length</var> is 0, throw an error.</li>
        <li>
          Read <var>length</var> bytes from <var>bytes</var> and decode them as
          DRISL ([<a href="#ref-drisl" class="ref">drisl</a>]) into <var>metadata</var>. If <var>metadata</var> is
          not a map, throw an error.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>metadata</var> does not have a <code>version</code> key entry
          with integer value <code>1</code>, throw an error. Otherwise, store
          <code>version</code> in <var>version</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>metadata</var> does not have a <code>roots</code> key entry
          that is an array, or if that array contains anything other than DASL
          CIDs, throw an error. Otherwise, store <code>roots</code> in
          <var>roots</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return <var>metadata</var>. (For implementations that only report
          <code>version</code> and <code>roots</code>, return those.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After its header, CAR contains a series of blocks each of which is
        prefixed with a small header of its own capturing the block's size and
        CID.
      </p>
      <p>
        The steps to <dfn id="dfn-parse-a-car-block-header">parse a CAR block header</dfn> are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accept a byte stream <var>bytes</var>.</li>
        <li>Read an unsigned varint <var>length</var> from <var>bytes</var> ([<a href="#ref-varint" class="ref">varint</a>]).</li>
        <li>If <var>length</var> is 0, throw an error.</li>
        <li>
          Read a CID ([<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>]) from <var>bytes</var> and store it in <var>cid</var>.
          Note: the length of the CID can be inferred by reading its metadata
          step by step until the <code>hash size</code> part, which is then used
          to consume that many bytes from <var>bytes</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set <var>CID length</var> to the number of bytes that were required to
          read the CID.
        </li>
        <li>Set <var>block size</var> to <var>length</var> minus <var>CID length</var>.</li>
        <li>
          Return <var>block size</var> and <var>cid</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          A CAR stream must only feature DASL CIDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CAR stream must have CIDs that match the block that follows
          them. A CAR implementation should verify that CIDs match blocks, though
          it may delegate verification to other components. (Keep in mind that not
          verifying at all negates the value of content addressing.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A CAR stream's stated roots must match CIDs contained in the data.
          However, implementations frequently operate in a streaming fashion such that
          they have no way of knowing whether a CAR stream conforms to this
          requirement before having processed the entire stream. Checking
          correctness with respect to this requirement may therefore be more
          readily performed via a warning (at end of processing) or a dedicated
          validator.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Determinism</h3>
        <p>
          Deterministic CAR creation is not covered by this specification. However, deterministic
          generation of a CAR from a given graph is possible and is relied upon by certain uses of
          the format, most notably, <a href="https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs">Filecoin</a>.
          dCAR may be the topic of a future specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care regarding the ordering of the <code>roots</code> array in the Header and avoidance
          of duplicate blocks may also be required for strict determinism.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Security &amp; Verifiability</h3>
        <p>
          The roots specified by the Header of a CAR should appear somewhere in its Data section,
          however there is no requirement that the roots define entire DAGs, nor that all blocks
          in a CAR must be part of DAGs described by the root CIDs in the Header. Therefore, the
          roots must not be used alone to determine or differentiate the contents of a CAR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CAR format contains no internal means, beyond the blocks and their CIDs, to verify
          or differentiate contents. Where such a requirement exists, this must be performed
          externally, such as creating a digest of the entire CAR (and refer to it using a CID).
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Appendix: Media Type</h2>
      <p>
        The media type for CAR is
        <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car"><code>application/vnd.ipld.car</code></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conventional file extension for CAR is <code>.car</code>.
