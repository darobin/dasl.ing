      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The CAR format (Content Addressable aRchives) is used to store series of
        content-addressable objects as a sequence of bytes. It packages that stream of
        objects with a header.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the content of this specification was initially developed as part
        of the <a href="https://github.com/ipld/ipld">IPLD</a> project. This specification
        was developed based on demand from the community to have just the one simplified
        document. Note that a CARv2 specification was developed at some point to add
        support for an index trailer, but it met with limited adoption and so was not
        considered when bringing CAR into DASL.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Parsing CAR</h2>
      <p>
        The CAR format comprises a sequence of length-prefixed block data, where the first
        block in the CAR is the Header encoded as dCBOR42, and the remaining blocks form
        the Data component of the CAR and are each additionally prefixed with their CIDs ([<a href="#ref-dcbor42" class="ref">dcbor42</a>], [<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>]).
        The length prefix of each block in a CAR is encoded as an unsigned variable-length
        integer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128">LEB128</a> integer ([<a href="#ref-leb128" class="ref">leb128</a>]).
        This integer specifies the number of remaining bytes for that block entry, excluding
        the bytes used to encode the integer, but including the CID for non-header blocks.
      </p>
      <pre><code>|------- Header -------| |------------------- Data -------------------|

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Accept a byte stream <var>bytes</var> that is consumed with every step
          that reads from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the steps to <a href="#dfn-parse-a-car-header" class="dfn-ref">parse a CAR header</a> with <var>bytes</var> to obtain

            <li>
              Read <var>block size</var> bytes from <var>bytes</var> and store the
              result in <var>block</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Push an entry onto <var>blocks</var> containing <var>cid</var>,
              <var>block size</var>, and <var>block</var>.
            </li>
            <li>Return to the beginning of these substeps.</li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The CAR header encodes both a <code>version</code>, which is always 1, and
        an array of <code>roots</code>, which is a list of CIDs. A CAR can be used
        to contain one or more DAGs of dCBOR42 content and the purpose of the
        <code>roots</code> is to list one or more roots for those DAGs. The array
        may be empty if you do not care about encoding DAGs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Some implementations expect there to always be at
        least one root. If you do not wish to indicate a root but have to
        interoperate with those implementations, you can always use the empty
        DASL CID <code>\x01\x55\x12\x00</code> instead.

        <li>

          not a map, throw an error.

        <li>
          If <var>object</var> does not have a <code>version</code> key entry
          with integer value <code>1</code>, throw an error. Otherwise, store
          <code>version</code> in <var>version</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>object</var> does not have a <code>roots</code> key entry
          that is an array, or if that array contains anything other than DASL

        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After its header, CAR contains a series of blocks each of which is
        prefixed with a small header of its own capturing the block's size and
        CID.

        <li>
          Read a CID ([<a href="#ref-cid" class="ref">cid</a>]) from <var>bytes</var> and store it in <var>cid</var>.
          Note: the length of the CID can be inferred by reading its metadata
          step by step until the <code>hash size</code> part, which is then used

      <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Conformance</h3>
        <p>
          A CAR stream must only feature DASL CIDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CAR stream must have CIDs that match the block that follows
          them. A CAR implementation should verify that CIDs match blocks, though
          it may delegate verification to other components. (Keep in mind that not
          verifying at all negates the value of content addressing.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A CAR stream's stated roots must match CIDs contained in the data.
          However, implementations frequently operate in a streaming fashion such that
          they have no way of knowing whether a CAR stream conforms to this
          requirement before having processed the entire stream. Checking
          correctness with respect to this requirement may therefore be more
          readily performed via a warning (at end of processing) or a dedicated
          validator.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Determinism</h3>
        <p>
          Deterministic CAR creation is not covered by this specification. However, deterministic
          generation of a CAR from a given graph is possible and is relied upon by certain uses of
          the format, most notably, <a href="https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs">Filecoin</a>.
          dCAR may be the topic of a future specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care regarding the ordering of the <code>roots</code> array in the Header and avoidance
          of duplicate blocks may also be required for strict determinism.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Security &amp; Verifiability</h3>
        <p>
          The roots specified by the Header of a CAR should appear somewhere in its Data section,
          however there is no requirement that the roots define entire DAGs, nor that all blocks
          in a CAR must be part of DAGs described by the root CIDs in the Header. Therefore, the
          roots must not be used alone to determine or differentiate the contents of a CAR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CAR format contains no internal means, beyond the blocks and their CIDs, to verify
          or differentiate contents. Where such a requirement exists, this must be performed
          externally, such as creating a digest of the entire CAR (and refer to it using a CID).
        </p>

      <h2>Appendix: Media Type</h2>
      <p>
        The media type for CAR is
        <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car"><code>application/vnd.ipld.car</code></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conventional file extension for CAR is <code>.car</code>.
