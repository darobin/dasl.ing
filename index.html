        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          DASL ("dazzle") is a small set of simple, standard primitives to work on content-addressed data.
          We call it "data-addressed" because it supports a data serialization component that makes
          content-addressing sweet and easy when working with data. The design is taken from the
          <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> universe, but simplified so as to improve interoperability,
          decrease costs, and work well with the web. More specifically, our priorities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>pave the cowpaths</strong>: we focus on supporting what people trying to solve real-world
            problems actually use. This takes over any consideration of engineering ideals or theoretical purity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>extensibility vs optionality</strong>: extensibility is important for long-lived distributed
            systems, because the world will happen and you will need to change. But introducing optionality
            reduces interoperability and increases cost of both implementation and adoption. So rather than
            require support for many options now, we have extension points now but deliberately don't use their
            full range.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>don't make me think</strong>: you don't want to be thinking about content addressing. You
            want to grab this off the shelf and have something that works out of the box. Nothing weird, no
            impedance mismatch with the systems you know and love (or maybe know and hate, but whatever, it
            just works).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>lightweight loading</strong>: some people like JavaScript, others don't. We don't care, we
            just want things that work. What's certain is that you can't ignore it and be relevant. The ability
            to ship small code to the browser is critical.
          </li>
        </ul>
