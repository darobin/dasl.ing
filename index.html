        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          DASL ("dazzle") is a small set of simple, standard primitives for working with content-addressed,
          linked data. It builds on content addressing, a proven approach used in Git and
          <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/">IPFS</a> to
          create reliable content identifiers (known as CIDs) through cryptographic hashing. Content addressing
          enables robust data integrity checks and efficient networking: systems can verify they received exactly
          what they asked for and avoid downloading the same content twice. The linked data part lets you link to
          stuff by its hash. You can build very big graphs with these primitives, such as the graph behind Bluesky.
        </p>
        <p>
          We call DASL "data-addressed" because it supports a data serialization component that makes
          <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing">content-addressing</a> sweet and easy when
          working with data. The design is taken from subcomponents of the
          <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS</a> universe, but simplified to improve
          interoperability, decrease costs, and work well with the web. More specifically, our priorities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>pave the cowpaths</strong>: we focus on supporting what people trying to solve real-world
            problems actually use. This takes over any consideration of engineering ideals or theoretical purity.
            We're retconning the spec to what people actually use implement — as it should be.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>extensibility vs optionality</strong>: extensibility is important for long-lived distributed
            systems, because the world will happen and you will need to change. But introducing optionality
            reduces interoperability and increases cost of both implementation and adoption. So rather than
            require support for many options now, we have extension points now but deliberately don't use their
            full range.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>don't make me think</strong>: you don't want to be thinking about content addressing. You
            want to grab this off the shelf and have something that works out of the box. Nothing weird, no
            impedance mismatch with the systems you know and love (or maybe know and hate, but whatever, it
            just works).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>lightweight loading</strong>: some people like JavaScript, others don't. We don't care, we
            just want things that work. What's certain is that you can't ignore it and be relevant. The ability
            to ship small code to the browser is critical.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is intended to work for the community, to grow support for what we need. If you have thoughts, don't
          be shy and <a href="https://github.com/darobin/dasl.ing/issues">submit an issue</a>! No stupid questions,
          don't assume everyone else has context that you don't. If this page isn't enough to understand DASL,
          then we're the ones who screwed up.

        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p>
          DASL is a strict subset of IPFS CIDs and IPLD, so existing IPFS and IPLD implementations will just
          read DASL CIDs and dCBOR42 without so much as a hiccup. Some implementations also specifically target a DASL subset.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some implementations that partially or fully support DASL:</p>

        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p>
          There are two specifications in DASL: <a href="#cid">CIDs</a> and <a href="#dcbor42">dCBOR42</a>. CIDs
          (Content IDs) are identifiers used for addressing resources by their contents, as in IPFS; dCBOR42
          (deterministically-serialized CBOR with optional CBOR tag <code>42</code> supported)
          is a serialization format that is deterministic and aware of CID-linked graphs, i.e. "IPLD".
        </p>
        <section id="cid">
          <h3>Content IDs (CIDs)</h3>
          <p>
            DASL CIDs are a strict subset of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CIDs</a>a>
            (but you don't need to understanding anything about IPFS to either use or implement them) with the following properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only modern CIDv1 CIDs are used, not legacy CIDv0.</li>
            <li>
              Only the lowercase base32 multibase encoding (the <code>b</code> prefix) is used for human-readable
              (and subdomain-usable) string encoding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only the <code>raw</code> binary multicodec (0x55) and <code>dag-cbor</code> multicodec (0x71), with the
              latter used only for dCBOR42-conformant DAGs.
            </li>
            <li>Only SHA-256 (0x12) and BLAKE3 hash functions (0x1e), and the latter only in certain circumstances.</li>
            <li>
              Regardless of size, resources <em>should not</em> be "chunked" into a DAG or Merkle tree (as historically done with
              UnixFS canonicalization in IPFS systems) but rather hashed in their entirety and content-addressed directly.
            </li>
            <li>
              This set of options has the added advantage that all the aforementioned single-byte prefixes require no
              additional varint processing or byte-fiddling.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supporting two hashes isn't ideal, but having one hash type that can stream large resources (and do incremental
            verification mid-stream) is a plus. Because BLAKE3 is still far from being supported by web browsers, it is
            strongly recommended that CID producers limit themselves to SHA-256 if possible. Implementations intending to
            run in web contexts are likely to either forego BLAKE3 verification in-browser, outsource verification to a
            trusted component, or to have to dynamically load a BLAKE3 library in the browser, which may cause latency.

          <h3>Deterministic CBOR with tag 42 (dCBOR42)</h3>
          <p>
            dCBOR42 is a form of IPLD that serializes only to deterministic CBOR, by normalizing and reducing some type
            flexibility. Notably, we support no ADLs.
            (See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">current draft specification for dCBOR</a>,
            and <a href="https://ftp.linux.cz/pub/internet-drafts/draft-bormann-cbor-det-01.html">Carsten Bormann's BCP document
            on the underspecified determinism of Section 4.2 of the CBOR specification</a>). For debugging purposes, either
            one-way conversion to DAG-JSON or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cbor-edn-literals/">CBOR
            Extended Diagnostic Notation</a> can be used, but either way, note that the CIDs in such debugging outputs
            should be the CIDs of the dCBOR42 content, not of other debugging resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further details forthcoming.
