        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          DASL ("dazzle") is a small set of simple, standard primitives to work on content-addressed data.
          We call it "data-addressed" because it supports a data serialization component that makes
          content-addressing sweet and easy when working with data. The design is taken from the
          <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> universe, but simplified so as to improve interoperability,
          decrease costs, and work well with the web. More specifically, our priorities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>pave the cowpaths</strong>: we focus on supporting what people trying to solve real-world
            problems actually use. This takes over any consideration of engineering ideals or theoretical purity.
            We're retconning the spec to what people actually use implement — as it should be.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>extensibility vs optionality</strong>: extensibility is important for long-lived distributed
            systems, because the world will happen and you will need to change. But introducing optionality
            reduces interoperability and increases cost of both implementation and adoption. So rather than
            require support for many options now, we have extension points now but deliberately don't use their
            full range.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>don't make me think</strong>: you don't want to be thinking about content addressing. You
            want to grab this off the shelf and have something that works out of the box. Nothing weird, no
            impedance mismatch with the systems you know and love (or maybe know and hate, but whatever, it
            just works).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>lightweight loading</strong>: some people like JavaScript, others don't. We don't care, we
            just want things that work. What's certain is that you can't ignore it and be relevant. The ability
            to ship small code to the browser is critical.

        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p>
          DASL is a strict subset of IPFS CIDs and IPLD, so existing IPFS and IPLD implementations will just
          read DASL without so much as a hiccup. Some implementations also specifically target a DASL subset.

        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p>
          There are two specifications in DASL: <a href="#cid">CIDs</a> and <a href="#dcbor42">dCBOR42</a>. CIDs
          (Content IDs) are identifiers used for content addressing and dCBOR42 (deterministic CBOR with tag 42)
          is a serialization format that is deterministic and supports CID links.
        </p>
        <section id="cid">
          <h3>Content IDs (CIDs)</h3>
          <p>
            DASL CIDs are a strict subset of IPFS CIDs (but you don't need to understanding anything about IPFS to
            either use or implement them) with the following properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only v1, no v0.</li>
            <li>Only lowercase base32 multibase encoding (the <code>b</code> prefix) for the string, human-readable encoding.</li>
            <li>Only the raw-binary codec (0x55) and dag-cbor (0x71), with the latter used for dCBOR42.</li>
            <li>Only SHA-256 (0x12) and Blake3 hashes (0x1e).</li>
            <li>No blocks.</li>
            <li>This set of options has the added advantage that no varint processing is required.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supporting two hashes isn't ideal, but having one hash type that can stream the verification of large
            resources is a plus. Because Blake-3 isn't supported by web browsers, it is strongly recommended that
            CID producers limit themselves to SHA-256 unless the alternative isn't possible. Implementations intended
            to run in web contexts are likely to either not verify Blake-3 hashes or to have to dynamically load
            a Blake-3 library, which may cause latency.

          <h3>Deterministic CBOR with tag 42 (dCBOR42)</h3>
          <p>
            dCBOR42 is a subset of IPLD that only supports DAG-CBOR serialization (DAG-JSON can be used for debugging
            purposes, but the CIDs embedded in it should be the CIDs that correspond to the CBOR serialization) and
            that uses the IETF's deterministic CBOR encoding rules to guarantee a deterministic output.

            Further details TBD.
