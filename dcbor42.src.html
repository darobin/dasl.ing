    <title>Deterministic CBOR with tag 42 (dCBOR42)</title>

      <p>
        dCBOR42 is a serialization format that is deterministic (so that the same
        data will have the same CID) and that features native support for using
        CIDs as links.
      </p>
    </div>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Deterministic encodings that produce the same stream of bytes for any
        given data with the same semantics are particularly useful in a content-addressed
        context. dCBOR42 provides that. Additionally, it supports CBOR Tag 42 that
        contains a CID ([[cid]]). This CID can be used for content-addressed linking
        between dCBOR42 documents and to raw resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        dCBOR42 does not fork CBOR, CDE, or dCBOR ([[cbor]], [[cde]], [[dcbor]]).
        Any decoder for any of those CBOR variants will be able to read dCBOR42
        content, and an encoder for those variants should be able to produce
        correct dCBOR42 if configured with the right option and given
        appropriately-prepared data.
      </p>

      <h2>Format</h2>
      <p>
        dCBOR42 is an application profile of dCBOR ([[dcbor]]) with the following
        constraints:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementations must support Tag 42 (see <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR
          Tag registry</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementations must reject all other tags, this includes any of the tags
          listed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8949#section-3.4">section
          3.4 of RFC 8949</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementations must reject map keys that are not strings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All other requirements are as dCBOR ([[dcbor]]).
      </p>

      <h2>Debugging Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        It is often convenient to represent dCBOR42 in textual formats for debugging
        purposes, for example using JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        One common convention to do so is "DAG-JSON" which is a JSON expression
        of the dCBOR42 data in which CIDs are represented as
        <code>{ "/": "string CID" }</code>. Another option is
        <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cbor-edn-literals/">CBOR
        Extended Diagnostic Notation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, note that the CIDs used in such debugging outputs that may
        point to <em>other</em> parts of the debugging output should be the CIDs
        of the dCBOR42 content, not of the debugging resources.
