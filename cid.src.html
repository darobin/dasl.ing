      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        DASL CIDs are a simple structured identifier format for content addressing. They encapsulate a hash
        with enough metadata to be extensible (to add new hash types in the future) and to indicate whether
        they are pointing to raw bytes or to structured data. If you're simply DASL CIDs as identifiers, you
        can almost certainly just use the string as an opaque ID and worry no further.
      </p>
      <p>
        A DASL CID can be represented as a string or as an array of bytes. If you wish to understand the
        internals of a CID, it has the following structure:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A <code>b</code> prefix (only in string form). This is an extensibility point for future
          CID encodings other than the current base32 to be supported. (Currently this is the only one.)
        </li>
        <li>
          A version number, which is currently always 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          A content codec, which is a flag indicating whether it is pointing to structured or raw
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          A hash type, that is always SHA-256 ([[sha256]]).
        </li>
        <li>
          A hash size, indicating how many bytes long the digest is.
        </li>
        <li>
          A digest, which is the hash of the content being identified.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Parsing CIDs</h2>
      <p>
        Use the following steps to <dfn>parse a CID string</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accept a string <var>CID</var>.</li>
        <li>Remove the first character from <var>CID</var> and store it in <var>prefix</var>.</li>
        <li>If <var>prefix</var> is not equal to <code>b</code>, throw an error.</li>
        <li>
          Decode the rest of <var>CID</var> using
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-6">the base32 algorithm from
          RFC4648</a> with a lowercase alphabet and store the result in <var>CID bytes</var> ([[rfc4648]]).
        </li>
        <li>Return the result of applying the steps to <a>decode a CID</a> to <var>CID bytes</var>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Use the following steps to <dfn>parse a binary CID</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accept an array of bytes <var>binary CID</var>.</li>
        <li>
          Remove the first byte in <var>binary CID</var> and store it in <var>prefix</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>prefix</var> is not equal to <code>0</code> (a null byte, the binary base256
          prefix), throw an error.
        </li>
        <li>Store the rest of <var>binary CID</var> in <var>CID bytes</var>.</li>
        <li>Return the result of applying the steps to <a>decode a CID</a> to <var>CID bytes</var>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Use the following steps to <dfn>decode a CID</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accept an array of bytes <var>CID bytes</var>.</li>
        <li>
          Remove the first byte in <var>CID bytes</var> and store it in <var>version</var>.
        </li>
        <li>If <var>version</var> is not equal to <code>1</code>, throw an error.</li>
        <li>
          Remove the next byte in <var>CID bytes</var> and store it in <var>codec</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>codec</var> is not equal to <code>0x55</code> (raw) or <code>0x71</code> (dCBOR42),
          throw an error ([[dcbor42]]).
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the next two bytes in <var>CID bytes</var> and store them in <var>hash type</var> and
          <var>hash size</var>, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <var>hash type</var> is not equal to <code>0x12</code> (SHA-256) or <code>0x1e</code> (BLAKE3),
          throw an error ([[sha256]], [[blake3]]).
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are fewer than <var>hash size</var> bytes left in <var>CID bytes</var>, throw an error.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the first <var>hash size</var> bytes from <var>CID bytes</var> and store them in
          <code>digest</code>. Store the rest in <var>remaining bytes</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return <var>version</var>, <var>codec</var>, <var>hash type</var>, <var>hash size</var>,
          <var>digest</var>, and <var>remaining bytes</var>.
        </li>

      <h2>Relationship to IPFS</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need to understand IPFS in order to use DASL. This section is for informational
        purposes only.
      </p>
      <p>
        DASL CIDs are a strict subset of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CIDs</a>
        with the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only modern CIDv1 CIDs are used, not legacy CIDv0.</li>
        <li>
          Only the lowercase base32 multibase encoding (the <code>b</code> prefix) is used for human-readable
          (and subdomain-usable) string encoding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only the <code>raw</code> binary multicodec (0x55) and <code>dag-cbor</code> multicodec (0x71), with the
          latter used only for dCBOR42-conformant DAGs.
        </li>
        <li>Only SHA-256 (0x12) for the hash function .</li>
        <li>
          The CID isn't the boss of anyone, but the expectation is that, regardless of size, resources
          <em>should not</em> be "chunked" into a DAG or Merkle tree (as historically done with UnixFS canonicalization
          in IPFS systems) but rather hashed in their entirety and content-addressed directly. That being
          said, a DASL CID can point to a piece of dCBOR42 metadata that describes this kind of
          chunking, if needed. (A separate specification may be added for that.)
        </li>
        <li>
          This set of options has the added advantage that all the aforementioned single-byte prefixes require no
          additional varint processing or byte-fiddling.
        </li>
      </ul>
