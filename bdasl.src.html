        BDASL extends DASL CIDs with a new hash type that works better for large files but isn't
        available by default in browsers, and therefore not an appropriate option in most
        situations.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        BDASL extends DASL CIDs by adding BLAKE3 support ([[blake3]). BLAKE3 is a powerful hashing
        framework that works well for progressive verification of large streams. Unfortunately,
        it isn't available in browser (and neither is streaming hashing in general) which makes it
        inappriopriate for inclusion as the primary hash function in DASL CIDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended to avoid using BDASL CIDs in arbitrary open environments, and rather to
        focus on using such CIDs in specific cases in which participants are likely to know how
        to handle them.

      <h2>Parsing BDASL CIDs</h2>
      <p>
        All the parsing works the same as for DASL CIDs ([[cid]]) with one modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the steps to <a href="cid.html#decode-a-cid">decode a CID</a>, the <var>hash type</var>
        may also be equal to <code>0x1e</code> (BLAKE3) ([[blake3]]).
